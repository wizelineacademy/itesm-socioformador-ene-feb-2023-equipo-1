It is our interest that, in those cases, Side Jobs do not interfere in any way with the Wizeliners\u00b4 job at Wizeline. This Policy outlines the rules and provisions that all Wizeliners need to follow prior to and while engaging in any Side Job.\n\n\n\nWhat is a Side Job? We defne a side job as paid, regular work (temporary or permanent) with specifc job responsibilities. For example, working at a shop qualifes as a side job if you are expected to work there regularly, regardless of whether you have pre-determined shifts or a fxed number of hours. Managing a business, working as a consultant or advisor to companies and serving as a board member of an organization fall under our defnition too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior Approval\n\n\n\nBefore accepting any Side Job, Wizeliners must frst seek approval from Wizeline following the procedure set forth in this Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for approval\n\n\n\nNo request under this Policy will be approved in the event the relevant Side Job relates to a Wizeline competitor or in the event it may create a new confict of interest, or an appearance of a confict of interest.\n\n\n\nA confict of interest may arise, without limitation, in the event the Side Job is directly related to the business in which Wizeline is involved, and/or in the event the Side Job could be competitive with or otherwise pose a threat to Wizeline\u2019s business interests.\n\n\n\nSide Jobs must not compete with, confict with or compromise Wizeline\u2019s interests or adversely affect job performance and the ability", "doc_id": "05f8f1d1-a201-4af1-8a5d-ae19b0722805", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b2fc5cf528d4a8d819d2950d8e019fc35c47678f20daa3528322886ed0e55f07", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3435}, "relationships": {"1": "9fd80712-6a6e-466e-a1ae-06b184bde355", "3": "4eadda30-c4fd-4be8-af1f-0f4e42034cf7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4eadda30-c4fd-4be8-af1f-0f4e42034cf7": {"__data__": {"text": "accepting any Side Job, Wizeliners must frst seek approval from Wizeline following the procedure set forth in this Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for approval\n\n\n\nNo request under this Policy will be approved in the event the relevant Side Job relates to a Wizeline competitor or in the event it may create a new confict of interest, or an appearance of a confict of interest.\n\n\n\nA confict of interest may arise, without limitation, in the event the Side Job is directly related to the business in which Wizeline is involved, and/or in the event the Side Job could be competitive with or otherwise pose a threat to Wizeline\u2019s business interests.\n\n\n\nSide Jobs must not compete with, confict with or compromise Wizeline\u2019s interests or adversely affect job performance and the ability to fulfll all responsibilities to Wizeline.\n\n\n\nEmployees are prohibited from performing any services for customers of Wizeline that are normally performed by Wizeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPage 4 \u2022 Wizeline - Moonlighting Policy |\tINTERNAL ONLY - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, no request under this policy will be approved in the event the Side Job adversely impacts or is likely to adversely impact the Wizeliners job performance, work hours, scheduling, or their employment relationship with Wizeline.
