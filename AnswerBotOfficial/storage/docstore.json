It is our interest that, in those cases, Side Jobs do not interfere in any way with the Wizeliners\u00b4 job at Wizeline. This Policy outlines the rules and provisions that all Wizeliners need to follow prior to and while engaging in any Side Job.\n\n\n\nWhat is a Side Job? We defne a side job as paid, regular work (temporary or permanent) with specifc job responsibilities. For example, working at a shop qualifes as a side job if you are expected to work there regularly, regardless of whether you have pre-determined shifts or a fxed number of hours.
